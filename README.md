Getting Reactive - Event Driven sequential process flow

Need to process multiple async events in a process? Like soldiers taking commands, send them messages to run in order. Lined up like Tin soldiers, listing for directions – shout out. Boom done.

No callback hell, no promise chain embedding, brackets be-gone! Event driven processing via an event chain – too easy.
